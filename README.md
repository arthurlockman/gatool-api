# GATool API

![gatool-api deploy status](https://github.com/arthurlockman/gatool-api/actions/workflows/main_gatool-api.yml/badge.svg)

gatool is a tool to provide **_FIRSTÂ®_** Game Announcers with up to date information while announcing events during the **_FIRST_** Robotics season. As a web-based tool, it uses up-to-date information about the event to provide a comprehensive set of useful data to Game Announcers. It is designed to work on desktops, laptops and tablet devices. In a pinch, it can be used on a mobile phone.

gatool relies on data from APIs provided by [**_FIRST_**](https://frc-api-docs.firstinspires.org), [The Blue Alliance](https://www.thebluealliance.com/apidocs/v3), [statbotics.io](https://www.statbotics.io/docs/rest), as well as its own data sources. We created the gatool APIs to provide a single access point for the gatool and for other tools that want to use its data. We ask that if you build a tool that uses gatool APIs, that you include "Data provided by the **_FIRST_** Game Announcer Tool API" and a link to this page in your application/service.
