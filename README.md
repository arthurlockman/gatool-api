# GATool API

![gatool-api deploy status](https://github.com/arthurlockman/gatool-api/actions/workflows/main_gatool-api.yml/badge.svg)

gatool is a tool to provide FIRSTÂ® Game Announcers with up to date information while announcing events during the FIRST Robotics season. As a web-based tool, it uses up-to-date information about the event to provide a comprehensive set of useful data to Game Announcers. It is designed to work on desktops, laptops and tablet devices. In a pinch, it can be used on a mobile phone.

You will need a login to access the tool. All registered GAs and MCs will receive an invitation with a login and password.

## Contributions

We welcome any and all contributions! Please feel free to fork the repository and contribute back to our development. [Issues can be filed in the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/arthurlockman/gatool-api/issues/new).

## Development

This section has information on how to build and deploy the project.

### Building

GAtool's backend is built on nodejs. To run the application, run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:arthurlockman/gatool-api.git
cd gatool-api
npm i
npm run start:no-redis
```

The app won't be able to do anything without proper Azure key authentication. This means development outside our core team will be difficult.

### Deployment

GAtool is deployed on Azure. We are using Azure Block Storage for user uploads, and Azure VMs to host the service itself. We deploy using [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io) to our hosts.
